# AI _ChatBot
Botpress is a browser-based platform for building AI chatbots. It provides tools for building chatbots that can perform tasks like booking events, placing orders, and welcoming users. 
Botpress is an open-source platform that provides the boilerplate code and infrastructure needed to get a chatbot up and running. Its drag-and-drop interface allows developers and non-developers to build, deploy, and manage chatbots. 
Chatbots are conversational tools that perform routine tasks efficiently. They are often powered by natural language processing (NLP) technology, which allows them to understand human-like conversations. 
Botpress is free to use and is suitable for bot building enthusiasts and individual developers. It is used by organizations such as the Quebec Government, Windstream, Husqvarna, and VR Bank.
